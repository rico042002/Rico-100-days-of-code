# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 6, 2023
![It Has Begun](https://github.com/rico042002/Rico-100-days-of-code/blob/master/img/mk.gif?raw=true)

**Today's Progress**: Learned about flexbox and started new project site. Continuing the course "Modern HTML & CSS From The Beginning (Including Sass)" by Brad Traversy

**Thoughts:** I struggle with coding daily. At times, frustration threatens to consume me as I fight to comprehend programming concepts that others seem to grasp effortlessly. Every line of code feels like an intricate puzzle, and debugging can become an all-consuming battle. My self-doubt looms, and I've questioned whether I have what it takes to be a programmer for years. This round is more important than the previous ones, my support system is few in numbers but consists of some of the best programmers any beginner could ask for!

### Day 2: August 7, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: Contiued project site with the course, learned more about flexbox and used CSS Variables.

**Thoughts:** It feels good to be coding daily, I plan on holding my streak without breaking stride. I have plenty of work to do and a lot of material to cover. I'm going to finish two more Udemy courses to prepare myself for daily challenges on iCodeThis.

### Day 3: August 8, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Finished homepage and started inner pages for the course, took CSS test and got 17/20 with a little help from devdocs.io

**Thoughts:** I have a lot to learn, but I don't feel overwhelmed or stupid when I learn with Brad, I'm going to stick to his courses to prepare for iCodeThis, then after I'm creating a project a day I'll probably start appAcademy or #100devs, I've also heard good things about The Odin Project. Even though I'm taking a class this semester I won't slack on coding daily!

### Day 4: August 9, 2023

**Today's Progress**: I finished the website project today, used JQuery library also a new one I've never used called Lightbox V2, also wrote a few scripts for smooth scrolling and a transition effect on the navbar.

**Thoughts:** Had fun coding today. Learned a lot of new things about libraries and the way CSS works. I did not know the big difference between ".class1.class2" and ".class1 .class2" I've been using them interchangeably for years without realizing the difference in precedence until today. Started learning about the basics of Web Hosting and the different types that are available.

### Day 5: August 10, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Uploaded site to github and deployed via Netlify, learned about the different types of Web Hosting and Form Submission. 

**Thoughts:** I had another excellent day, this course is too much fun and I look forward to learning more and making my own projects soon. By day 50 I will be knocking down iCodeThis challenges daily!

### Day 6: August 11, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Fixed submission problem with Form on EegeLedger website! Learned about CSS Transform, Transition, Box/Text Shadow properties.

**Thoughts:** After two days of worrying about why my form wasn't submitting, I continued watching the course to find out that my JavaScript was stopping my form from submitting! Which is exactly what I read in a forum the same night before coming back to it the next day. It was a small bug but it felt really good to finally fix it and move on in the course. I was actually about to do another YouTube tutorial to get better with Netlify's forum submission system. It is easy, I just need to be careful of my event handlers in JS. Did a short build yesterday because I thought I didn't understand it well and ended up with a quick premade site that taught me more about forms and HTML5 markup.

**Today's Progress**: Completed Presentation website project, and learned more about animation and keyframes.

**Thoughts:** Making good pace on the course, I'm about 60% finished and will be moving on to the Javascript course, then 50 Projects in 50 Days. After those two I will have enough knowledge to complete some of the basic iCodeThis challenges.

### Day 8: August 13, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Finished another one of the mini project websites, a pure CSS Hamburger Menu.

**Thoughts:** It took a lot of CSS to make a simple Hamburger Menu, loved this project because it showed me a CSS selector I have never used '~'

### Day 9: August 14, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: Completed Knowledge Timeline project and deployed it, started Dropdown Menu website. 

**Thoughts:** I'm enjoying coding more these days, by deciding to do an hour a day the stress level and pressure of finishing a boot camp kind of fade away. I just want to get better at recreating layouts and be good enough to start freelancing on Upwork and Fiverr. I have a long way to go but I'm getting there day by day.

### Day 10: August 15, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: Finished Dropdown menu site and committed the code, started learning the basics of CSS Grid

**Thoughts:** It's awesome how Brad explains stuff, I'm learning a lot, and taking notes. All while creating projects that I can actually use in the future. I can't wait to check out his JavaScript course. I was looking at some iCodeThis challenges and some of them are really hard! Like creating a dynamic calendar with a task list. I'll get there eventually, all I have to do is press forward, try my best, and give it my ALL!!!

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, and worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
