# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 6, 2023
![It Has Begun](https://github.com/rico042002/Rico-100-days-of-code/blob/master/img/mk.gif?raw=true)

**Today's Progress**: Learned about flexbox and started new project site. Continuing the course "Modern HTML & CSS From The Beginning (Including Sass)" by Brad Traversy

**Thoughts:** I struggle with coding daily. At times, frustration threatens to consume me as I fight to comprehend programming concepts that others seem to grasp effortlessly. Every line of code feels like an intricate puzzle, and debugging can become an all-consuming battle. My self-doubt looms, and I've questioned whether I have what it takes to be a programmer for years. This round is more important than the previous ones, my support system is few in numbers but consists of some of the best programmers any beginner could ask for!

### Day 2: August 7, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: Contiued project site with the course, learned more about flexbox and used CSS Variables.

**Thoughts:** It feels good to be coding daily, I plan on holding my streak without breaking stride. I have plenty of work to do and a lot of material to cover. I'm going to finish two more Udemy courses to prepare myself for daily challenges on iCodeThis.

### Day 3: August 8, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Finished homepage and started inner pages for the course, took CSS test and got 17/20 with a little help from devdocs.io

**Thoughts:** I have a lot to learn, but I don't feel overwhelmed or stupid when I learn with Brad, I'm going to stick to his courses to prepare for iCodeThis, then after I'm creating a project a day I'll probably start appAcademy or #100devs, I've also heard good things about The Odin Project. Even though I'm taking a class this semester I won't slack on coding daily!

### Day 4: August 9, 2023

**Today's Progress**: I finished the website project today, used JQuery library also a new one I've never used called Lightbox V2, also wrote a few scripts for smooth scrolling and a transition effect on the navbar.

**Thoughts:** Had fun coding today. Learned a lot of new things about libraries and the way CSS works. I did not know the big difference between ".class1.class2" and ".class1 .class2" I've been using them interchangeably for years without realizing the difference in precedence until today. Started learning about the basics of Web Hosting and the different types that are available.

### Day 5: August 10, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Uploaded site to github and deployed via Netlify, learned about the different types of Web Hosting and Form Submission. 

**Thoughts:** I had another excellent day, this course is too much fun and I look forward to learning more and making my own projects soon. By day 50 I will be knocking down iCodeThis challenges daily!

### Day 6: August 11, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Fixed submission problem with Form on EegeLedger website! Learned about CSS Transform, Transition, Box/Text Shadow properties.

**Thoughts:** After two days of worrying about why my form wasn't submitting, I continued watching the course to find out that my JavaScript was stopping my form from submitting! Which is exactly what I read in a forum the same night before coming back to it the next day. It was a small bug but it felt really good to finally fix it and move on in the course. I was actually about to do another YouTube tutorial to get better with Netlify's forum submission system. It is easy, I just need to be careful of my event handlers in JS. Did a short build yesterday because I thought I didn't understand it well and ended up with a quick premade site that taught me more about forms and HTML5 markup.

### Day 7: August 12, 2023
![Celebration](https://github.com/rico042002/Rico-100-days-of-code/blob/master/img/week1.gif?raw=true)

**Today's Progress**: Completed Presentation website project, and learned more about animation and keyframes.

**Thoughts:** Making good pace on the course, I'm about 60% finished and will be moving on to the Javascript course, then 50 Projects in 50 Days. After those two I will have enough knowledge to complete some of the basic iCodeThis challenges.

**Link to website:** [iCodeThis](https://icodethis.com/)

### Day 8: August 13, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Finished another one of the mini project websites, a pure CSS Hamburger Menu.

**Thoughts:** It took a lot of CSS to make a simple Hamburger Menu, loved this project because it showed me a CSS selector I have never used '~'

### Day 9: August 14, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: Completed Knowledge Timeline project and deployed it, started Dropdown Menu website. 

**Thoughts:** I'm enjoying coding more these days, by deciding to do an hour a day the stress level and pressure of finishing a boot camp kind of fade away. I just want to get better at recreating layouts and be good enough to start freelancing on Upwork and Fiverr. I have a long way to go but I'm getting there day by day.

### Day 10: August 15, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: Finished Dropdown menu site and committed the code, started learning the basics of CSS Grid

**Thoughts:** It's awesome how Brad explains stuff, I'm learning a lot, and taking notes. All while creating projects that I can actually use in the future. I can't wait to check out his JavaScript course. I was looking at some iCodeThis challenges and some of them are really hard! Like creating a dynamic calendar with a task list. I'll get there eventually, all I have to do is press forward, try my best, and give it my ALL!!!

### Day 11: August 16, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Learning all about CSS Grid - Columns, Rows, Spans, Minmax, and Grid Areas.

**Thoughts:** Today was not a good day but I still pushed through my hour of code. I usually have fun and the time flies by, today I was faced with distractions at work and within myself. I've learned through reading that showing up on bad days matters more than good when building habits though, I made it through today's challenge and tomorrow will be better.

### Day 12: August 17, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Finished basics of CSS Grid, learned about media queries with CSS Grid, almost finished with News Grid webpage.

**Thoughts:** Had a lot of fun today, did the course for 2.5 hours! I'm 80% done with it and ready to start the JS course, the first 12hrs are free on YouTube so I might have enough content to last me until payday and then I will purchase it. Get up to speed with Modern JS, read a few books, and do my best to complete a challenge a day on iCodeThis. Danny Thompson said he was "loving the consistency" in the #100daysOfCode "Commit Your Code" discord! I'm just trying to get better at making sites and DSA so that by the time I graduate getting a job won't be so hard.

### Day 13: August 18, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Completed News Grid website

**Thoughts:** Finished News Gird website, and got a refreshing lecture on Git, Github, and Netlify.

### Day 14: August 19, 2023
![Week 2 Completed](https://github.com/rico042002/Rico-100-days-of-code/blob/master/img/week2.gif?raw=true)

**Today's Progress**: Finished SASS section of the course, starting the final Portfolio Project.

**Thoughts:** This is the final project of the course, I will be done in 2 days minimum. I'm going to work on the HTML&CSS youtube playlist Brad Traversy made for a developer roadmap so I can brush up on all the topics I've learned, and then move on to the Javascript list which includes the course I want to buy. That way I can start the 50days50projects course closer to day 50.

### Day 15: August 20, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Set up everything for the portfolio project, and made the main header and navbar.

**Thoughts:** Sass is not easy, the nesting is confusing sometimes but I'm getting the hang of it. It's not that I don't like it, just not used to the syntax.

### Day 16: August 21, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: Continued Portfolio Project, almost done with the landing page.

**Thoughts:** Had fun today, and had a bunch of issues with typos, so I guess you can say it was an off day. Forgot a quotation mark in a data set for a javascript function so the typewriter effect didn't originally work, then I had padding issues that I think had more to do with the fact that Brad records his course videos from big screen TVs, so I had to use 10% padding, where his suggestion is 20%. Either way it was fun to debug some code and have some issues to make everything the way I wanted it to look.

### Day 17: August 22, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Finished home landing page, started about.html

**Thoughts:** Using Sass and animations has increased the time on the videos but they are still entertaining and educating me so much on CSS! I want to learn so much more about it so I can make cool layouts and pages in the future.

### Day 18: August 23, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: Finished about page!

**Thoughts:** Learned some cool CSS tricks, like how to create a progress bar with pure CSS. I also understand how and when Divs are needed, I'm making awesome pace on the course and I'm five videos away from being done! I'm probably going to continue the HTML/CSS part of the roadmap before jumping into JavaScript, but I will definitely be getting his JS Course soon.

### Day 19: August 24, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Finished work page, and started the contact page.

**Thoughts:** Almost done with the course, going to continue with the HTML/CSS part of the roadmap. I think I counted 64 different projects on the YouTube list, which is a lot. I want to finish them in good time and do a minimum of two per day, I have more than enough content to last me for payday to come around again and buy the JavaScript course.

### Day 20: August 25, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the contact page, almost finished

**Thoughts:** Built form and learned more about Sass nesting, should be done with the course by the end of the weekend.

### Day 21: August 26, 2023 
![Week 2 Completed](https://github.com/rico042002/Rico-100-days-of-code/blob/master/img/week3.gif?raw=true)

**Today's Progress**: Finished contact page, and media queries, uploaded and deployed to Netlify, and completed course!!!

**Thoughts:** I finished the entire course in 21 days which is kind of ironic because it was exactly 21 hours of content and I was coding an hour a day. So I guess I'm right on time 😆 So I'm going to start hacking down at the HTML/CSS list so I can code every day. There is plenty of work to do and much to learn. I added the certificate of completion to my LinkedIn because this is the first one I've finished in a while.

### Day 22: August 27, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: Started "Microsoft Homepage Clone" Tutorial

**Thoughts:** Udemy is having a five-day sale on courses! I'm going to purchase the Javascript course on Tuesday and do my best to finish the massive amount of videos there are on the YouTube playlist which includes this video. I have plenty of work to do but I'm having fun in the process.

### Day 23: August 28, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Almost done with Microsoft Homepage

**Thoughts:** Should be finished and deploying the cloned homepage tomorrow. Did the hero section, and main section, and started styling the footer. So tomorrow should be media queries and deployment on Netlify.

### Day 24: August 29, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Done with Microsoft Homepage clone, re-started Learn How To Make a Website with Steph to finish the project.

**Thoughts:** Had fun today, almost coded for two hours. Switched up coding teachers today, started this project a week ago on the side, and wasn't tracking the time on doing it because I plan on adding a special page for my daughter. It's a personal project because she really likes Unicorns and I think she's going to love it if I add some of her pics and the right CSS and animations.

### Day 25: August 30, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Continued Make a Website with Steph, built navbar 

**Thoughts:** Made the navigation and put the final touches on this short course. I'm on lesson 12 of 16 and the videos aren't too long, but I'm learning a lot about CSS, that's why I'm also enjoying learning from her. I also purchased the "Modern Javascript from the Beginning" course by Brad Traversy today! Today was the last day it would be on sale for $15 so I went ahead and did it. I will still be doing the HTML/CSS builds when I have the time. I'm just trying to stay on the path all while not overwhelming myself with work that doesn't matter again.

### Day 26: August 31, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Finished website build!

**Thoughts:** Had some issues with my gulp file but I didn't watch the final video of the course and ended up removing it. I still want to figure out how to deploy with gulp so I'll probably check it out tomorrow and re-do it. Get to start the JavaScript course after

### Day 27: September 1, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Deleted original build and re-deployed with Gulp and added working form submissions

**Thoughts:** I couldn't help myself. Even though the site was up and working just fine, I wanted to know how she deployed to Netlify with a gulp build process. I've only used gulp once before in a JavaScript course with Wes Bos and my laptop was so old at the time I didn't even have Node.JS on it because it was so slow. She shows how to add a build function and how to change your JSON file to include a build process. I learned a lot from a course that seemed easy at first. Now it's time to start the Javascript course with Brad and continue to do YouTube builds on the side. I don't want to burn out so I'm not sure if I should track or make the website builds mandatory, just projects to keep me fresh and remind me I'm preparing for iCodeThis challenges.

![Week 4](https://github.com/rico042002/Rico-100-days-of-code/blob/master/img/week4.gif?raw=true)

**Today's Progress**: Started "Modern JavaScript From The Beginning 2.0 - 2023 Revamp"

**Thoughts:** I've learned JS in a few different ways, this is the second course I've ever taken on it. And it has been a LONG time. I plan on learning enough to build my own stuff and not just follow along with tutorials. After I get to a place where I can recreate layouts I will move on to Data Structures and Algorithms.

### Day 29: September 3, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Learned about Primitive and Reference Data Types and how they are accessed in the stack and heap. 

**Thoughts:** Learned all about the typeOf() operator and how null being an object was a freak accident in JS. The beginning of the course seems to be explaining everything going on under the hood, which is awesome, I'm excited to learn more about it and how to get better with it.

### Day 30: September 4, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: Went over Type-conversion, Type-coercion, and Assignment operators. 

**Thoughts:** I really have gone back to the basics. This course teaches JavaScript on a fundamental level and I love when he stops to explain how things work under the hood in JS. There is a lot of weird behavior that has made it hard to work with over the years. I'm hoping this is the course to solidify my understanding of basic fundamentals in programming.

### Day 31: September 5, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Tried to solve the Capitalize Challenge 

**Thoughts:** I actually worked on the challenge the whole hour working on the challenge and still had to look at the answer at the final 15 minutes. I was close but still didn't get it all the way right. I figured out how to capitalize the first letter but not how to bring the rest of the letters in. I didn't know you could use two methods on a string like that ".substring(1)" will give every single letter after the first one and I didn't know that. I kept trying to use .split() and .join() Maybe I was just overthinking a simple problem. I felt so bad about not getting it that I solved some kata on code wars for the first time in years. I need to get better at working with JavaScript, and the only way is to expose myself to it daily.

### Day 32: September 6, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Learned about Numbers, Dates/Times, and Math Objects, and solved the Number Challenge on my first attempt!

**Thoughts:** Didn't struggle too hard on today's challenge, I was really excited about solving it on my first try. I want to get better at web development and programming. Realizing they are two different subjects was the greatest epiphany I've had since doing this. Learned about a few math methods and properties today and dates-times.

### Day 33: September 7, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Worked with Dates-Times, Date Methods, and DateTimeFormat API, also started the Arrays & Objects section and did Array Basics.

**Thoughts:** Learning a lot of fundamentals that I did not know existed in JavaScript, this course is totally worth it. And today Brad released his DSA JavaScript course! I already got it in my cart on Udemy and I'm buying it as soon as I can! Having fun with JS but I still need to build projects so I don't get rusty on CSS and my git commands. 

**Link to work:** [70+ JavaScript Challenges: Data Structures & Algorithms](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-challenges/)

### Day 34: September 8, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Covered more Array methods, concat, and used the spread operator for the first time. Solved 2 Array Challenges on the first try. 

**Thoughts:** Still covering the basics, I've seen most of this before but these are damn good use cases and explanations. He even breaks down when the method creates a new array, that subject used to be very confusing. Now I'm armed with a little bit of knowledge that could help me in a real-world situation. I can't wait to finish this course and try out the DSA, but I still haven't lost sight of my goal to make it to the top of iCodeThis.

![Week 5](https://github.com/rico042002/Rico-100-days-of-code/blob/master/img/week5.gif?raw=true)

**Today's Progress**: Today was all about Objects, Object literals, Destructuring Objects & Arrays, also learned a little bit about JSON.

**Thoughts:** Today was fun, learned a lot about Objects and Key/Value pairs. After the JSON video ends I have a new challenge, can't wait to try to solve it tomorrow!

### Day 36: September 10, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: Finished Arrays & Objects section, completed Object Challenge. 

**Thoughts:** I am learning a lot of useful information in this course! I thought I understood destructuring but it seems like I need to refresh on it because the power to change an object on the fly like that is crazy. I didn't know you could implicitly change a variable into a string by just writing it, you don't even need parentheses! JS does have a lot of weird behavior that goes against its own rules but hey I still love it LoL

### Day 37: September 11, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: Started Functions & Scope section, learned about functions, parameters, arguments, global/local/function/block level scope. 

**Thoughts:** I knew I hated the var keyword! I used to have a hard time understanding why my variables would pass and not pass arguments when I originally tried to finish FreeCodeCamp DSA section! It actually used to drive me crazy on why my functions would not work correctly, now years later I found out about how funny it is on the scope and why it was replaced with let and const. As a person who enjoys C++, I love strict types 😂

**Link to work:** [JavaScript Functions and Scope – a Beginner's Guide](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-functions-and-scope/)

### Day 38: September 12, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Went over Nested Scope, Function Declaration VS. Function Expression, and how IIFE functions work. Solved the first Challenge. Two more to do tomorrow. 

**Thoughts:** I actually had fun today, even though I wasn't feeling it because today has been busy, I still made myself sit down and start. Even though I felt like the hour was going to take forever, before I knew it I was taking good notes and learning cool stuff. This course has so much value it's unreal, Brad should really consider starting an online boot camp or something because he knows what he is doing.

### Day 39: September 13, 2023
##### (Wife Birthday ♍🎂)

**Today's Progress**: Finished all three Function Challenges without looking at the solution! 

**Thoughts:** I'm VERY proud of myself, I usually can't solve algorithm challenges. They used to stomp me every time, but this course is like putting years of reading JS syntax I've learned to good use. My answers were NOTHING like Brad's but they were still 100% correct, and that's what I LOVE about programming. There can be multiple solutions to the same problem. Each with its own strengths and takeaways. I'm definitely not missing any days anytime soon, I wanna get the certificate for this course because I definitely earned it this time 😊

### Day 40: September 14, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: Watched Brad's solutions to the function challenges. Learned about Execution Context - The Memory Creation Phase/Execution Phase.

**Thoughts:** Mostly took notes today. Learning more of what goes on behind the scenes of JavaScript. It makes me think about that Udemy Course "JavaScript: Understanding The Weird Parts". I was gifted this course almost 3 freaking years ago and still haven't done it. I'll get it done eventually, but I'm loving learning all this cool stuff about JS. And I know I have been putting links to FreeCodeCamp articles, these relate to the subject at hand and are good buffers for my learning.

### Day 41: September 15, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Completed Function & Scope section, started Logic & Control Flow. Learned about the Call Stack and If statements. 

**Thoughts:** Took some notes on the Call Stack, found out I can't screenshot images on Udemy, which sucks because it's hard drawing out all the charts and visual information I see. It will be fine though, I can always come back to it if I need the information in the future. Had a refresher on If statements. I'm probably going to finish the slot machine build this weekend after I take my Psychology Exam.

![Week 5](https://github.com/rico042002/Rico-100-days-of-code/blob/master/img/week6.gif?raw=true)

**Today's Progress**: Went over Switch statements, passed the Calculator Challenge, and learned about Truthy and Falsy values.

**Thoughts:** The time really flies by in this course, I guess you have a good time when you're enjoying learning. Got an 88 on my first Psychology Exam, my average in the class is 95. I'm doing good on both fronts and I plan on keeping it up.

### Day 43: September 17, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: Finished Logic & Control Flow section, started Loops, Iteration & Array Methods. Learned about Logical Assignment/Operators, Ternary Operator, and For Loops. 

**Thoughts:** Today was kind of sluggish, mostly because I've been busy this weekend. Still got some psychology homework due tomorrow. Decided to take care of it tomorrow afternoon. I need to start coding early in the day so it doesn't conflict with my schedule, but for the biggest part, I've been a night coder 🦉😭

### Day 44: September 18, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: Completed the FizzBuzz Challenge! Mostly went over loops today, While/Do-While Loops, Break and continue statements and the For-Of Loop

**Thoughts:** The first time I saw the FizzBuzz challenge was in the book "Eloquent Javascript", which was like five years ago. Back then I didn't have half the mind to solve it. Books and courses back then used to teach you the basics of conditionals and barely cover iteration and expect you to be able to print out a triangle with a nested for loop or do the fizz buzz challenge. These days I'm able to break problems down into pieces and solve them little by little. I still need to make a website though! It's been too many days! But between class and life, I've been super busy, I'll get to it.

### Day 45: September 19, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: Learned the basics of Higher Order Methods, .forEach(), .filter(), also solved a .filter() challenge that was given during the lesson.  

**Thoughts:** Lost track of time coding today! The hour was over before I knew it. It started off slow but I was having fun before I knew it. Higher-order methods are powerful, so I'm making sure I take plenty of notes in the sandbox.

### Day 46: September 20, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: Continued learning about Higher Order Methods, .filter(), .map(), .reduce()

**Thoughts:** Making it to the complicated subjects now so I'm being sure I keep notes and test myself at every challenge. He throws in some short in-course challenges to complete a task before he does while pausing the video. I used to skip challenges like that but now I find myself pausing and trying to figure it out on my own which seems to help with the learning process. .map() is powerful as hell, I don't know if I'm correct in believing that it coerces types. I saw it turn an object into an array and vice versa.

### Day 0: September 0, 2023 EXAMPLE
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, and worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
