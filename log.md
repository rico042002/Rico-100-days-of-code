# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 6, 2023
![It Has Begun](https://github.com/rico042002/Rico-100-days-of-code/blob/master/img/mk.gif?raw=true)

**Today's Progress**: Learned about flexbox and started new project site. Continuing the course "Modern HTML & CSS From The Beginning (Including Sass)" by Brad Traversy

**Thoughts:** I struggle with coding daily. At times, frustration threatens to consume me as I fight to comprehend programming concepts that others seem to grasp effortlessly. Every line of code feels like an intricate puzzle, and debugging can become an all-consuming battle. My self-doubt looms, and I've questioned whether I have what it takes to be a programmer for years. This round is more important than the previous ones, my support system is few in numbers but consists of some of the best programmers any beginner could ask for!

### Day 2: August 7, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: Contiued project site with the course, learned more about flexbox and used CSS Variables.

**Thoughts:** It feels good to be coding daily, I plan on holding my streak without breaking stride. I have plenty of work to do and a lot of material to cover. I'm going to finish two more Udemy courses to prepare myself for daily challenges on iCodeThis.

### Day 3: August 8, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Finished homepage and started inner pages for the course, took CSS test and got 17/20 with a little help from devdocs.io

**Thoughts:** I have a lot to learn, but I don't feel overwhelmed or stupid when I learn with Brad, I'm going to stick to his courses to prepare for iCodeThis, then after I'm creating a project a day I'll probably start appAcademy or #100devs, I've also heard good things about The Odin Project. Even though I'm taking a class this semester I won't slack on coding daily!

### Day 4: August 9, 2023

**Today's Progress**: I finished the website project today, used JQuery library also a new one I've never used called Lightbox V2, also wrote a few scripts for smooth scrolling and a transition effect on the navbar.

**Thoughts:** Had fun coding today. Learned a lot of new things about libraries and the way CSS works. I did not know the big difference between ".class1.class2" and ".class1 .class2" I've been using them interchangeably for years without realizing the difference in precedence until today. Started learning about the basics of Web Hosting and the different types that are available.

### Day 5: August 10, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Uploaded site to github and deployed via Netlify, learned about the different types of Web Hosting and Form Submission. 

**Thoughts:** I had another excellent day, this course is too much fun and I look forward to learning more and making my own projects soon. By day 50 I will be knocking down iCodeThis challenges daily!

### Day 6: August 11, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Fixed submission problem with Form on EegeLedger website! Learned about CSS Transform, Transition, Box/Text Shadow properties.

**Thoughts:** After two days of worrying about why my form wasn't submitting, I continued watching the course to find out that my JavaScript was stopping my form from submitting! Which is exactly what I read in a forum the same night before coming back to it the next day. It was a small bug but it felt really good to finally fix it and move on in the course. I was actually about to do another YouTube tutorial to get better with Netlify's forum submission system. It is easy, I just need to be careful of my event handlers in JS. Did a short build yesterday because I thought I didn't understand it well and ended up with a quick premade site that taught me more about forms and HTML5 markup.

### Day 7: August 12, 2023
![Celebration](https://github.com/rico042002/Rico-100-days-of-code/blob/master/img/week1.gif?raw=true)

**Today's Progress**: Completed Presentation website project, and learned more about animation and keyframes.

**Thoughts:** Making good pace on the course, I'm about 60% finished and will be moving on to the Javascript course, then 50 Projects in 50 Days. After those two I will have enough knowledge to complete some of the basic iCodeThis challenges.

**Link to website:** [iCodeThis](https://icodethis.com/)

### Day 8: August 13, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Finished another one of the mini project websites, a pure CSS Hamburger Menu.

**Thoughts:** It took a lot of CSS to make a simple Hamburger Menu, loved this project because it showed me a CSS selector I have never used '~'

### Day 9: August 14, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: Completed Knowledge Timeline project and deployed it, started Dropdown Menu website. 

**Thoughts:** I'm enjoying coding more these days, by deciding to do an hour a day the stress level and pressure of finishing a boot camp kind of fade away. I just want to get better at recreating layouts and be good enough to start freelancing on Upwork and Fiverr. I have a long way to go but I'm getting there day by day.

### Day 10: August 15, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: Finished Dropdown menu site and committed the code, started learning the basics of CSS Grid

**Thoughts:** It's awesome how Brad explains stuff, I'm learning a lot, and taking notes. All while creating projects that I can actually use in the future. I can't wait to check out his JavaScript course. I was looking at some iCodeThis challenges and some of them are really hard! Like creating a dynamic calendar with a task list. I'll get there eventually, all I have to do is press forward, try my best, and give it my ALL!!!

### Day 11: August 16, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Learning all about CSS Grid - Columns, Rows, Spans, Minmax, and Grid Areas.

**Thoughts:** Today was not a good day but I still pushed through my hour of code. I usually have fun and the time flies by, today I was faced with distractions at work and within myself. I've learned through reading that showing up on bad days matters more than good when building habits though, I made it through today's challenge and tomorrow will be better.

### Day 12: August 17, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Finished basics of CSS Grid, learned about media queries with CSS Grid, almost finished with News Grid webpage.

**Thoughts:** Had a lot of fun today, did the course for 2.5 hours! I'm 80% done with it and ready to start the JS course, the first 12hrs are free on YouTube so I might have enough content to last me until payday and then I will purchase it. Get up to speed with Modern JS, read a few books, and do my best to complete a challenge a day on iCodeThis. Danny Thompson said he was "loving the consistency" in the #100daysOfCode "Commit Your Code" discord! I'm just trying to get better at making sites and DSA so that by the time I graduate getting a job won't be so hard.

### Day 13: August 18, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Completed News Grid website

**Thoughts:** Finished News Gird website, and got a refreshing lecture on Git, Github, and Netlify.

### Day 14: August 19, 2023
![Week 2 Completed](https://github.com/rico042002/Rico-100-days-of-code/blob/master/img/week2.gif?raw=true)

**Today's Progress**: Finished SASS section of the course, starting the final Portfolio Project.

**Thoughts:** This is the final project of the course, I will be done in 2 days minimum. I'm going to work on the HTML&CSS youtube playlist Brad Traversy made for a developer roadmap so I can brush up on all the topics I've learned, and then move on to the Javascript list which includes the course I want to buy. That way I can start the 50days50projects course closer to day 50.

### Day 15: August 20, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Set up everything for the portfolio project, and made the main header and navbar.

**Thoughts:** Sass is not easy, the nesting is confusing sometimes but I'm getting the hang of it. It's not that I don't like it, just not used to the syntax.

### Day 16: August 21, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: Continued Portfolio Project, almost done with the landing page.

**Thoughts:** Had fun today, and had a bunch of issues with typos, so I guess you can say it was an off day. Forgot a quotation mark in a data set for a javascript function so the typewriter effect didn't originally work, then I had padding issues that I think had more to do with the fact that Brad records his course videos from big screen TVs, so I had to use 10% padding, where his suggestion is 20%. Either way it was fun to debug some code and have some issues to make everything the way I wanted it to look.

### Day 17: August 22, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Finished home landing page, started about.html

**Thoughts:** Using Sass and animations has increased the time on the videos but they are still entertaining and educating me so much on CSS! I want to learn so much more about it so I can make cool layouts and pages in the future.

### Day 18: August 23, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: Finished about page!

**Thoughts:** Learned some cool CSS tricks, like how to create a progress bar with pure CSS. I also understand how and when Divs are needed, I'm making awesome pace on the course and I'm five videos away from being done! I'm probably going to continue the HTML/CSS part of the roadmap before jumping into JavaScript, but I will definitely be getting his JS Course soon.

### Day 19: August 24, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Finished work page, and started the contact page.

**Thoughts:** Almost done with the course, going to continue with the HTML/CSS part of the roadmap. I think I counted 64 different projects on the YouTube list, which is a lot. I want to finish them in good time and do a minimum of two per day, I have more than enough content to last me for payday to come around again and buy the JavaScript course.

### Day 20: August 25, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the contact page, almost finished

**Thoughts:** Built form and learned more about Sass nesting, should be done with the course by the end of the weekend.

### Day 21: August 26, 2023 
![Week 2 Completed](https://github.com/rico042002/Rico-100-days-of-code/blob/master/img/week3.gif?raw=true)

**Today's Progress**: Finished contact page, and media queries, uploaded and deployed to Netlify, and completed course!!!

**Thoughts:** I finished the entire course in 21 days which is kind of ironic because it was exactly 21 hours of content and I was coding an hour a day. So I guess I'm right on time 😆 So I'm going to start hacking down at the HTML/CSS list so I can code every day. There is plenty of work to do and much to learn. I added the certificate of completion to my LinkedIn because this is the first one I've finished in a while.

### Day 22: August 27, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: Started "Microsoft Homepage Clone" Tutorial

**Thoughts:** Udemy is having a five-day sale on courses! I'm going to purchase the Javascript course on Tuesday and do my best to finish the massive amount of videos there are on the YouTube playlist which includes this video. I have plenty of work to do but I'm having fun in the process.

### Day 23: August 28, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Almost done with Microsoft Homepage

**Thoughts:** Should be finished and deploying the cloned homepage tomorrow. Did the hero section, and main section, and started styling the footer. So tomorrow should be media queries and deployment on Netlify.

### Day 24: August 29, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Done with Microsoft Homepage clone, re-started Learn How To Make a Website with Steph to finish the project.

**Thoughts:** Had fun today, almost coded for two hours. Switched up coding teachers today, started this project a week ago on the side, and wasn't tracking the time on doing it because I plan on adding a special page for my daughter. It's a personal project because she really likes Unicorns and I think she's going to love it if I add some of her pics and the right CSS and animations.

### Day 25: August 30, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Continued Make a Website with Steph, built navbar 

**Thoughts:** Made the navigation and put the final touches on this short course. I'm on lesson 12 of 16 and the videos aren't too long, but I'm learning a lot about CSS, that's why I'm also enjoying learning from her. I also purchased the "Modern Javascript from the Beginning" course by Brad Traversy today! Today was the last day it would be on sale for $15 so I went ahead and did it. I will still be doing the HTML/CSS builds when I have the time. I'm just trying to stay on the path all while not overwhelming myself with work that doesn't matter again.

### Day 26: August 31, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Finished website build!

**Thoughts:** Had some issues with my gulp file but I didn't watch the final video of the course and ended up removing it. I still want to figure out how to deploy with gulp so I'll probably check it out tomorrow and re-do it. Get to start the JavaScript course after

### Day 27: September 1, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Deleted original build and re-deployed with Gulp and added working form submissions

**Thoughts:** I couldn't help myself. Even though the site was up and working just fine, I wanted to know how she deployed to Netlify with a gulp build process. I've only used gulp once before in a JavaScript course with Wes Bos and my laptop was so old at the time I didn't even have Node.JS on it because it was so slow. She shows how to add a build function and how to change your JSON file to include a build process. I learned a lot from a course that seemed easy at first. Now it's time to start the Javascript course with Brad and continue to do YouTube builds on the side. I don't want to burn out so I'm not sure if I should track or make the website builds mandatory, just projects to keep me fresh and remind me I'm preparing for iCodeThis challenges.

![Week 4](https://github.com/rico042002/Rico-100-days-of-code/blob/master/img/week4.gif?raw=true)

**Today's Progress**: Started "Modern JavaScript From The Beginning 2.0 - 2023 Revamp"

**Thoughts:** I've learned JS in a few different ways, this is the second course I've ever taken on it. And it has been a LONG time. I plan on learning enough to build my own stuff and not just follow along with tutorials. After I get to a place where I can recreate layouts I will move on to Data Structures and Algorithms.

### Day 29: September 3, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Learned about Primitive and Reference Data Types and how they are accessed in the stack and heap. 

**Thoughts:** Learned all about the typeOf() operator and how null being an object was a freak accident in JS. The beginning of the course seems to be explaining everything going on under the hood, which is awesome, I'm excited to learn more about it and how to get better with it.

### Day 30: September 4, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: Went over Type-conversion, Type-coercion, and Assignment operators. 

**Thoughts:** I really have gone back to the basics. This course teaches JavaScript on a fundamental level and I love when he stops to explain how things work under the hood in JS. There is a lot of weird behavior that has made it hard to work with over the years. I'm hoping this is the course to solidify my understanding of basic fundamentals in programming.

### Day 31: September 5, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Tried to solve the Capitalize Challenge 

**Thoughts:** I actually worked on the challenge the whole hour working on the challenge and still had to look at the answer at the final 15 minutes. I was close but still didn't get it all the way right. I figured out how to capitalize the first letter but not how to bring the rest of the letters in. I didn't know you could use two methods on a string like that ".substring(1)" will give every single letter after the first one and I didn't know that. I kept trying to use .split() and .join() Maybe I was just overthinking a simple problem. I felt so bad about not getting it that I solved some kata on code wars for the first time in years. I need to get better at working with JavaScript, and the only way is to expose myself to it daily.

### Day 32: September 6, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Learned about Numbers, Dates/Times, and Math Objects, and solved the Number Challenge on my first attempt!

**Thoughts:** Didn't struggle too hard on today's challenge, I was really excited about solving it on my first try. I want to get better at web development and programming. Realizing they are two different subjects was the greatest epiphany I've had since doing this. Learned about a few math methods and properties today and dates-times.

### Day 33: September 7, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Worked with Dates-Times, Date Methods, and DateTimeFormat API, also started the Arrays & Objects section and did Array Basics.

**Thoughts:** Learning a lot of fundamentals that I did not know existed in JavaScript, this course is totally worth it. And today Brad released his DSA JavaScript course! I already got it in my cart on Udemy and I'm buying it as soon as I can! Having fun with JS but I still need to build projects so I don't get rusty on CSS and my git commands. 

**Link to work:** [70+ JavaScript Challenges: Data Structures & Algorithms](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-challenges/)

### Day 34: September 8, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Covered more Array methods, concat, and used the spread operator for the first time. Solved 2 Array Challenges on the first try. 

**Thoughts:** Still covering the basics, I've seen most of this before but these are damn good use cases and explanations. He even breaks down when the method creates a new array, that subject used to be very confusing. Now I'm armed with a little bit of knowledge that could help me in a real-world situation. I can't wait to finish this course and try out the DSA, but I still haven't lost sight of my goal to make it to the top of iCodeThis.

![Week 5](https://github.com/rico042002/Rico-100-days-of-code/blob/master/img/week5.gif?raw=true)

**Today's Progress**: Today was all about Objects, Object literals, Destructuring Objects & Arrays, also learned a little bit about JSON.

**Thoughts:** Today was fun, learned a lot about Objects and Key/Value pairs. After the JSON video ends I have a new challenge, can't wait to try to solve it tomorrow!

### Day 36: September 10, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: Finished Arrays & Objects section, completed Object Challenge. 

**Thoughts:** I am learning a lot of useful information in this course! I thought I understood destructuring but it seems like I need to refresh on it because the power to change an object on the fly like that is crazy. I didn't know you could implicitly change a variable into a string by just writing it, you don't even need parentheses! JS does have a lot of weird behavior that goes against its own rules but hey I still love it LoL

### Day 37: September 11, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: Started Functions & Scope section, learned about functions, parameters, arguments, global/local/function/block level scope. 

**Thoughts:** I knew I hated the var keyword! I used to have a hard time understanding why my variables would pass and not pass arguments when I originally tried to finish FreeCodeCamp DSA section! It actually used to drive me crazy on why my functions would not work correctly, now years later I found out about how funny it is on the scope and why it was replaced with let and const. As a person who enjoys C++, I love strict types 😂

**Link to work:** [JavaScript Functions and Scope – a Beginner's Guide](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-functions-and-scope/)

### Day 38: September 12, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Went over Nested Scope, Function Declaration VS. Function Expression, and how IIFE functions work. Solved the first Challenge. Two more to do tomorrow. 

**Thoughts:** I actually had fun today, even though I wasn't feeling it because today has been busy, I still made myself sit down and start. Even though I felt like the hour was going to take forever, before I knew it I was taking good notes and learning cool stuff. This course has so much value it's unreal, Brad should really consider starting an online boot camp or something because he knows what he is doing.

### Day 39: September 13, 2023
##### (Wife Birthday ♍🎂)

**Today's Progress**: Finished all three Function Challenges without looking at the solution! 

**Thoughts:** I'm VERY proud of myself, I usually can't solve algorithm challenges. They used to stomp me every time, but this course is like putting years of reading JS syntax I've learned to good use. My answers were NOTHING like Brad's but they were still 100% correct, and that's what I LOVE about programming. There can be multiple solutions to the same problem. Each with its own strengths and takeaways. I'm definitely not missing any days anytime soon, I wanna get the certificate for this course because I definitely earned it this time 😊

### Day 40: September 14, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: Watched Brad's solutions to the function challenges. Learned about Execution Context - The Memory Creation Phase/Execution Phase.

**Thoughts:** Mostly took notes today. Learning more of what goes on behind the scenes of JavaScript. It makes me think about that Udemy Course "JavaScript: Understanding The Weird Parts". I was gifted this course almost 3 freaking years ago and still haven't done it. I'll get it done eventually, but I'm loving learning all this cool stuff about JS. And I know I have been putting links to FreeCodeCamp articles, these relate to the subject at hand and are good buffers for my learning.

### Day 41: September 15, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Completed Function & Scope section, started Logic & Control Flow. Learned about the Call Stack and If statements. 

**Thoughts:** Took some notes on the Call Stack, found out I can't screenshot images on Udemy, which sucks because it's hard drawing out all the charts and visual information I see. It will be fine though, I can always come back to it if I need the information in the future. Had a refresher on If statements. I'm probably going to finish the slot machine build this weekend after I take my Psychology Exam.

![Week 6](https://github.com/rico042002/Rico-100-days-of-code/blob/master/img/week6.gif?raw=true)

**Today's Progress**: Went over Switch statements, passed the Calculator Challenge, and learned about Truthy and Falsy values.

**Thoughts:** The time really flies by in this course, I guess you have a good time when you're enjoying learning. Got an 88 on my first Psychology Exam, my average in the class is 95. I'm doing good on both fronts and I plan on keeping it up.

### Day 43: September 17, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: Finished Logic & Control Flow section, started Loops, Iteration & Array Methods. Learned about Logical Assignment/Operators, Ternary Operator, and For Loops. 

**Thoughts:** Today was kind of sluggish, mostly because I've been busy this weekend. Still got some psychology homework due tomorrow. Decided to take care of it tomorrow afternoon. I need to start coding early in the day so it doesn't conflict with my schedule, but for the biggest part, I've been a night coder 🦉😭

### Day 44: September 18, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: Completed the FizzBuzz Challenge! Mostly went over loops today, While/Do-While Loops, Break and continue statements and the For-Of Loop

**Thoughts:** The first time I saw the FizzBuzz challenge was in the book "Eloquent Javascript", which was like five years ago. Back then I didn't have half the mind to solve it. Books and courses back then used to teach you the basics of conditionals and barely cover iteration and expect you to be able to print out a triangle with a nested for loop or do the fizz buzz challenge. These days I'm able to break problems down into pieces and solve them little by little. I still need to make a website though! It's been too many days! But between class and life, I've been super busy, I'll get to it.

### Day 45: September 19, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: Learned the basics of Higher Order Methods, .forEach(), .filter(), also solved a .filter() challenge that was given during the lesson.  

**Thoughts:** Lost track of time coding today! The hour was over before I knew it. It started off slow but I was having fun before I knew it. Higher-order methods are powerful, so I'm making sure I take plenty of notes in the sandbox.

### Day 46: September 20, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: Continued learning about Higher Order Methods, .filter(), .map(), .reduce()

**Thoughts:** Making it to the complicated subjects now so I'm being sure I keep notes and test myself at every challenge. He throws in some short in-course challenges to complete a task before he does while pausing the video. I used to skip challenges like that but now I find myself pausing and trying to figure it out on my own which seems to help with the learning process. .map() is powerful as hell, I don't know if I'm correct in believing that it coerces types. I saw it turn an object into an array and vice versa.

### Day 47: September 21, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: Finished .reduce() lesson and completed all 3 Array Method Challenges successfully! 

**Thoughts:** I had a ball today, I really start to look forward to the challenges and the opportunity to solve a problem on my own. Yes I do look back at my notes but that's it, I had to ask google how to check to see if a number was negative but it was a simple (if number is > 0) statement. I'm learning so much from this course. Actually chaining .filter and .map together and understanding everything that was happening is a new feeling to me! I usually don't know what's going on behind the scenes with JS but I have gained knowledge from this course and I'm loving it and can't wait to check out his DSA course.

### Day 48: September 22, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: Completed Iteration & Array Methods section, started DOM Section.

**Thoughts:** Started Document Object Model section. Getting through the course at a good pace. Found an awesome DOM Visualizer after seeing a chart in the course. 

**Link to work:** [DOM Visualizer](https://bioub.github.io/dom-visualizer/)

![Week 7](https://github.com/rico042002/Rico-100-days-of-code/blob/master/img/week7.gif?raw=true)

**Today's Progress**: Learned about DOM Methods and Single Element Selectors

**Thoughts:** Learning how to traverse the DOM and how to select elements and make them dynamic. Like how to make simple changes to the page like color and text without CSS

**Link to work:** [DOM Visualizer](https://bioub.github.io/dom-visualizer/)

### Day 50: September 24, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: Multiple Element Selectors, Traversing the DOM, Node Types and Relationships

**Thoughts:** Had to take plenty of notes today, didn't mind though. Made an AI-powered chart on Notion of the different Node Types, which was really cool. Time flies by when you're having fun! And I'm halfway there! 

# JavaScript Node Types

| Node Type | Description | Children |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Element | Element nodes, Text nodes, Comment nodes, Processing Instruction nodes, CDATA nodes, Entity Reference nodes |
| 2 | Attribute | Text nodes, EntityReference |
| 3 | Text | None  |
| 4 | CDATA | None |
| 5 | Entity | Element nodes, Processing Instruction nodes, Comment nodes, Text nodes, CDATA nodes, Entity Reference nodes |
| 6 | Entity Reference | Element nodes, Processing Instruction nodes, Comment nodes, Text nodes, CDATA nodes, Entity Reference nodes |
| 7 | Processing Instruction | None |
| 8 | Comment | None  |
| 9 | Document | Element nodes, Processing Instruction nodes, Comment nodes, Document Type nodes, Document Fragment nodes |
| 10 | Document Type | None |

### Day 51: September 25, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: Traversing Nodes in the DOM, learned how to create elements from JavaScript and the difference between innerHTML vs. createElement

**Thoughts:** Today's session started kind of sluggish but picked up 30mins in. Was issued a challenge to append elements to the page but didn't realize it would require a function because I've been working with the DOM for so many days. I'm considering working on FreeCodeCamps JS track in my free time to stay sharp on writing functions. 

**Link to work:** [Traversing the DOM Is Just Like Creating Your Personal Schedule](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/traversing-the-dom-is-just-like-creating-your-personal-schedule-30dacb1bebf0/)

### Day 52: September 26, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: Practiced on inserting and replacing elements in the DOM with insertBefore() and insertAdjacent() methods

**Thoughts:** Got defeated by my first challenge to create a custom insertAfter() function using insertBefore(). The answer was easier than I thought so I feel like I don't really understand the DOM, Iv'e went over a lot of methods, a lot of them achieving the same behavior so I do get a little lost sometimes. I feel like I need to do a refresher or look at some YouTube videos on how to traverse the DOM and create functions to do so.

### Day 53: September 27, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Learned about .removeChild(), .remove()/.add(), and the .classList

**Thoughts:** Finished with the DOM section, on to Events now!!

### Day 54: September 28, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: Started Event Listener section, passed first Event Listener Challenge.

**Thoughts:** Had fun today, the hour flew by fast AF. Took me like 15min to figure out the answer to the challenge, it was simple and complicated at the same time. But I have done enough tutorials in the past to at least know how to make one element in Javascript disappear on click. Seeing everyone getting awesome dev jobs and getting to live their dreams is inspiring me to work harder to achieve my goals. Hopefully after a few rounds of 100DaysOfCode, I have enough projects to at least freelance a little bit. 

**Link to work:** [Event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event)

### Day 55: September 29, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: Went over Mouse Events and the Event Object

**Thoughts:** Learning about how to make the page more dynamic, and how events relate to the elements in the DOM.

##### (Daughter's Birthday 🦄)  
![Week 8](https://github.com/rico042002/Rico-100-days-of-code/blob/master/img/week8.gif?raw=true)

**Today's Progress**: Learned about Keyboard Events and Codes

**Thoughts:** Today's lesson was fun and made me think about how powerful JavaScript is. I used to have a keystroke logger on a desktop I owned when I was younger. It made me wonder If I could re-create the program. It would actually log everything typed that day and put it inside a .txt file at the end of the day. Also started a mini-project and will be done with it by tomorrow. 

**Link to work:** [Table of all Key Codes](https://www.toptal.com/developers/keycode/table)

### Day 57: October 2, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: Finished Keycode mini project, and went over input events. 

**Thoughts:** Yesterday got a little weird due to my work schedule and lack of personal scheduling, and I ended up forgetting to code. Today's lesson was interesting and I learned a lot about event handlers and the way keycodes and input events work. 

**Link to work:** [Table of all Key Codes](https://www.toptal.com/developers/keycode/table)

### Day 58: October 3, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: Finished Events Section, learned about Event Bubbling, Event Delegation and Window Events

**Thoughts:** Today wasn't too bad, seemed like time was going a little slower. After all, I have learned I still feel like I need to read a book on JavaScript and test myself with Edabit or a website like it. It's hard to find beginner-level algorithm challenges, and Code Wars just has user-made-up questions so they are hit-and-miss on quality. I'll probably do FreeCodeCamp since I finished the Responsive Web Design section in 2022, it's time for a new one!

**Link to work:** [Window](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window)

### Day 59: October 4, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: Started Shopping List project, basically a Git and Github crash course.

**Thoughts:** Things started out slow, but picked up in the middle. I was worried about how long it seemed like and before I knew it I was learning about SSH keys and mardown files. I need to catch up on some rest and get ready to buckle down and study some more!

**Link to work:** [Shopping-List Repo](https://github.com/rico042002/shopping-list)

### Day 60: October 5, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: Continued Shopping list project, learned how to filter through text with .indexOf and .forEach methods

**Thoughts:** When I first saw the filter through text functionality in the project I was 100% sure regEx was being used but it was pure vanilla JS! So much has changed in JavaScript in such a short time 🤦🏿‍♂️ I'm going to continue my journey down this path of learning, it's not going to be an easy task to get a job in tech, but I'm down for the fight!

### Day 61: October 6, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: Learned about localStorage and sessionStorage, how to get and use it with JSON.parse and .stringify

**Thoughts:** Learning a lot about how to structure an app and make useful functions. Also the D-R-Y method of clean code.

**Link to work:** [How to Store Data in Web Browser Storage - localStorage and sessionStorage Explained](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-store-data-in-web-browser-storage-localstorage-and-session-storage-explained/)

### Day 62: October 7, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: Completed Shopping List App, deployed to Netlify, started Asynchronous section. 

**Thoughts:** Got plenty of quality lessons in this build, about local storage, functions, UI state, and how to build a app with vanilla JS. It may not be a fancy framework or library but I'm still having loads of fun with this course. I can't wait to code for a living!

**Today's Progress**: Learning the beginning of Asynchronous Programming, how setInterval/clearInterval setTimeout/clearTimeout works. 

**Thoughts:** Found an interesting blog post with cool animations to explain the Event Loop and how functions are moved to the task queue. I can't believe it's week 9 already! I'm making good time on the course and should be done in a couple of more weeks. Then it's on to 50 Days 50 Projects. I have gotten a lot of work done but I still want to do a little bit more, I've considered using FreeCodeCamp in my free time to quiz myself on JS.

### Day 64: October 9, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: HTTP Request Crash Course, Learned about AJAX, HTTP Status Codes, and XMLHttpRequest Object.

**Thoughts:** I'm 40% done with the course, I'm probably not going to make it to iCodeThis in this round of 100DaysOfCode, so I'm going to continue to do fun side tutorials and get some commits and builds in during my free time. I don't want to get rusty at building webpages while I'm focusing on JavaScript.

### Day 65: October 10, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: Finished AJAX/XHR lesson, and passed the Joke Generator Challenge!

**Thoughts:** Even though today was very stressful, I ended up finding flow in coding. I enjoy a good tutorial as much as the next programmer but these days I enjoy throwing on some cool loFi music and creating something. I actually did a random quote generator years ago with JS and jQuery! So this is my first time using vanilla JS to do this. It was actually way less code. Just happy I was able to solve the challenge without looking at the solution.

### Day 66: October 11, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: Learned about Callback Hell and Promises. 

**Thoughts:** Today's lesson was interesting. Learning about Promises makes me want to understand the way networks and servers handle data on the backend. I got the code for my old github pages portfolio and I'm refactoring it to present it as my new main one. Hopefully I can get some awesome projects under my belt by the next round of 100days.

### Day 67: October 12, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: Went over Promises more, learned about Promise.all and the difference between Callbacks and Promises, also finished Asynchronous JavaScript section. 

**Thoughts:** I'm learning some core concepts that I have heard thrown around for some years. This is my first time learning about Async JS and promises. I've never been good with APIs or built projects that even required them. I feel like I got some good key takeaway notes and I definitely have to commit my sandbox so I can have the JS notes, no matter which computer I'm using.

### Day 68: October 13, 2023 🐈‍⬛

**Today's Progress**: Learned about the Fetch API, and made a small project fetching data from a random user API

**Thoughts:** I haven't worked with an API in a while and it feels good to be getting some projects under my belt all while learning and having fun. This course makes me think about the weird parts of JS and I want to finish my course on it soon. I have plenty of coding and math to do in the coming year, with #100devs coming next year and I have to save to take a class or two in the Spring semester. Speaking of which I got an A+ in Gen. Psychology, so I'm one step closer to my computer science degree!

![Week 10](https://github.com/rico042002/Rico-100-days-of-code/blob/master/img/week10.gif?raw=true)

**Today's Progress**: Learned more about the Fetch API and how it handles errors, and HTTP Status Codes 

**Thoughts:** Worked on a few small projects, getting my commits up but It's time for me to work on a personal project and at least have one thing I'm proud of and call my own.

### Day 71: October 16, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: Learned about Async/Await and try/catch statements and how they relate to Promises and the fetch API

**Thoughts:** Time flew by in today's lesson, probably going to push my time up to two hours since I'm only halfway done with the course and I have so much work to do.

### Day 74: October 19, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: Started Movie Database API project

**Thoughts:** Started a new project that uses a movie database API that dynamically fetches information on popular movies and TV Shows, can't wait to see the finished result. I don't know if there will be a mobile version because this app seems to be massive. And if there is not a mobile then this will probably be the first project I put my own spin on to make it better!

**Today's Progress**: Fetched Data from movie API, connected movie and TV show HTML pages, and dynamically added them with JS

**Thoughts:** Had fun coding today even though today was very stressful. I want to make coding my career and I'm tired of waiting. I've given myself a two-year window to land my first job in tech. I should be able to hit it right on target, in the meantime 100DaysOfCode might turn into 730DaysOfCode until I land a job!

### Day 76: October 22, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: Continued Movie App build. 

**Thoughts:** Adding the API calls to the rest of the site. Putting in movie details, dates, and reviews. Had a hard time trying to format the date after the API call. going to try to fix it tomorrow. Missed yesterday because I worked 22 hours and literally didn't have time to code, the other two hours were dedicated to sleep, getting dressed, and driving to the second contract Security job I did.

**Today's Progress**: Finished Movie Details page, added date function and background images.

**Thoughts:** I actually created the date function last night when I kept thinking about it. Ended up combining code I learned from StackOverflow with a ChatGPT sample and I had it!

### Day 78: October 24, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: Added TV Show details information from API, finished details page, and added Swiper-JS to the landing page.

**Thoughts:** Had a little trouble with the date object because I was dynamically adding information to the page with for each and I was trying to set it to do it once on the object so I kept getting an error. Realized I was creating the date object in the wrong place after using ChatGPT. 

**Link to work:**

// Format the date using toLocaleDateString()
const formattedDate = date.toLocaleDateString();

console.log(formattedDate); // Output: Depends on the browser's locale settings, e.g., "10/19/2023" in US format
```

### Day 79: October 25, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: Finished adding Swiper.js, made a custom alert function, and started API search functionality. 

**Thoughts:** Today's lessons were not complicated but I still had to write plenty of notes, there are things I'm still finding out about JS. Didn't know you could set a parameter within the function parenthesis, I've actually never seen anyone do it 🤷🏿‍♂️

### Day 80: October 26, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: Finished search results functionality, almost done with the project.

**Thoughts:** Still had some issues with the date returns from the API, it formats them DD/MM/YYYY, and .toLocaleDateString isn't enough to switch them up. So I asked ChatGPT like I always do when I get in a bind 🤣 and it showed me I needed to create a custom date function 🤦🏿 I should have created one as many times as I re-did the date change. A simple function would have fixed the problem, but hey you live and learn. It's a process and I'm enjoying it. Tomorrow all I have to do is add pagination to the search results and I'm done with the project!

### Day 81: October 27, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Finished Flixx App

**Thoughts:** I don't know WTF happened, after I finished the ENTIRE app with over 500 lines of JS, all of a sudden I'm getting a 401 error and it says that my API key is invalid. IDK if it's because I added the site to Netlify or what. I'm also getting an "Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'forEach')" and I've been using these fucking .forEach the entire time. So I don't know what happened or what semicolon or parenthesis I accidentally deleted today. I'm using a laptop and I tend to scroll and accidentally delete stuff all the time, but I actually copied Brad's code and used my API key and got the same error about the .forEach. So I don't know if I should start the project over and accept the loss or re-do it and see where I went wrong. Coding usually doesn't put me on my bad side, but it's annoying to put so much work into a project just to slip and fall at the finish line. What bothers me the most is even when I use the code that I pushed yesterday it still doesn't work! Even though everything was perfectly fine. I learned a lot from the project and even though I can't show it I still have my code with my notes so there's that.

### Day 82: October 28, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: Started Web API section, learned about Geolocation API and Canvas. 

**Thoughts:** Last night after wondering what happened I generated a new Key from the Movie Database API and tried that key with my app then it started working again. So then I re-deployed it on Netlify and it stopped working again! So I'm pretty sure it's some sort of authentication error from publicly exposing my key that keeps it from working. It might be because Netlify is sending the request instead of VScode. I'm going to ask a friend about it soon. Today was kind of slow but I still had fun learning about APIs and using Leaflet.js

### Day 83: October 29, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: Completed Animated Clock project using requestAnimationFrame

**Thoughts:** Today's project was refreshing can't wait to add more to it tomorrow.

![Week 12](https://github.com/rico042002/Rico-100-days-of-code/blob/master/img/week12.gif?raw=true)

**Today's Progress**: Added color change on canvas functionality for the clock app. Also started the Audio API project.

**Thoughts:** As an old DJ/Rapper and music junkie, I loved today's lesson. The hour flew by before I knew it. The Web Audio API is twice as strong as it used to be when I first learned about it. I can't wait to use it in my own project in the future.

### Day 0: October 0, 2023 EXAMPLE
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, and worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
