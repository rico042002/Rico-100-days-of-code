# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 6, 2023
![It Has Begun](https://github.com/rico042002/Rico-100-days-of-code/blob/master/img/mk.gif?raw=true)

**Today's Progress**: Learned about flexbox and started new project site. Continuing the course "Modern HTML & CSS From The Beginning (Including Sass)" by Brad Traversy

**Thoughts:** I struggle with coding daily. At times, frustration threatens to consume me as I fight to comprehend programming concepts that others seem to grasp effortlessly. Every line of code feels like an intricate puzzle, and debugging can become an all-consuming battle. My self-doubt looms, and I've questioned whether I have what it takes to be a programmer for years. This round is more important than the previous ones, my support system is few in numbers but consists of some of the best programmers any beginner could ask for!

### Day 2: August 7, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: Contiued project site with the course, learned more about flexbox and used CSS Variables.

**Thoughts:** It feels good to be coding daily, I plan on holding my streak without breaking stride. I have plenty of work to do and a lot of material to cover. I'm going to finish two more Udemy courses to prepare myself for daily challenges on iCodeThis.

### Day 3: August 8, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Finished homepage and started inner pages for the course, took CSS test and got 17/20 with a little help from devdocs.io

**Thoughts:** I have a lot to learn, but I don't feel overwhelmed or stupid when I learn with Brad, I'm going to stick to his courses to prepare for iCodeThis, then after I'm creating a project a day I'll probably start appAcademy or #100devs, I've also heard good things about The Odin Project. Even though I'm taking a class this semester I won't slack on coding daily!

### Day 4: August 9, 2023

**Today's Progress**: I finished the website project today, used JQuery library also a new one I've never used called Lightbox V2, also wrote a few scripts for smooth scrolling and a transition effect on the navbar.

**Thoughts:** Had fun coding today. Learned a lot of new things about libraries and the way CSS works. I did not know the big difference between ".class1.class2" and ".class1 .class2" I've been using them interchangeably for years without realizing the difference in precedence until today. Started learning about the basics of Web Hosting and the different types that are available.

### Day 5: August 10, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Uploaded site to github and deployed via Netlify, learned about the different types of Web Hosting and Form Submission. 

**Thoughts:** I had another excellent day, this course is too much fun and I look forward to learning more and making my own projects soon. By day 50 I will be knocking down iCodeThis challenges daily!

### Day 6: August 11, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Fixed submission problem with Form on EegeLedger website! Learned about CSS Transform, Transition, Box/Text Shadow properties.

**Thoughts:** After two days of worrying about why my form wasn't submitting, I continued watching the course to find out that my JavaScript was stopping my form from submitting! Which is exactly what I read in a forum the same night before coming back to it the next day. It was a small bug but it felt really good to finally fix it and move on in the course. I was actually about to do another YouTube tutorial to get better with Netlify's forum submission system. It is easy, I just need to be careful of my event handlers in JS. Did a short build yesterday because I thought I didn't understand it well and ended up with a quick premade site that taught me more about forms and HTML5 markup.

### Day 7: August 12, 2023
![Celebration](https://github.com/rico042002/Rico-100-days-of-code/blob/master/img/week1.gif?raw=true)

**Today's Progress**: Completed Presentation website project, and learned more about animation and keyframes.

**Thoughts:** Making good pace on the course, I'm about 60% finished and will be moving on to the Javascript course, then 50 Projects in 50 Days. After those two I will have enough knowledge to complete some of the basic iCodeThis challenges.

### Day 8: August 13, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Finished another one of the mini project websites, a pure CSS Hamburger Menu.

**Thoughts:** It took a lot of CSS to make a simple Hamburger Menu, loved this project because it showed me a CSS selector I have never used '~'

### Day 9: August 14, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: Completed Knowledge Timeline project and deployed it, started Dropdown Menu website. 

**Thoughts:** I'm enjoying coding more these days, by deciding to do an hour a day the stress level and pressure of finishing a boot camp kind of fade away. I just want to get better at recreating layouts and be good enough to start freelancing on Upwork and Fiverr. I have a long way to go but I'm getting there day by day.

### Day 10: August 15, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: Finished Dropdown menu site and committed the code, started learning the basics of CSS Grid

**Thoughts:** It's awesome how Brad explains stuff, I'm learning a lot, and taking notes. All while creating projects that I can actually use in the future. I can't wait to check out his JavaScript course. I was looking at some iCodeThis challenges and some of them are really hard! Like creating a dynamic calendar with a task list. I'll get there eventually, all I have to do is press forward, try my best, and give it my ALL!!!

### Day 11: August 16, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Learning all about CSS Grid - Columns, Rows, Spans, Minmax, and Grid Areas.

**Thoughts:** Today was not a good day but I still pushed through my hour of code. I usually have fun and the time flies by, today I was faced with distractions at work and within myself. I've learned through reading that showing up on bad days matters more than good when building habits though, I made it through today's challenge and tomorrow will be better.

### Day 12: August 17, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Finished basics of CSS Grid, learned about media queries with CSS Grid, almost finished with News Grid webpage.

**Thoughts:** Had a lot of fun today, did the course for 2.5 hours! I'm 80% done with it and ready to start the JS course, the first 12hrs are free on YouTube so I might have enough content to last me until payday and then I will purchase it. Get up to speed with Modern JS, read a few books, and do my best to complete a challenge a day on iCodeThis. Danny Thompson said he was "loving the consistency" in the #100daysOfCode "Commit Your Code" discord! I'm just trying to get better at making sites and DSA so that by the time I graduate getting a job won't be so hard.

### Day 13: August 18, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Completed News Grid website

**Thoughts:** Finished News Gird website, and got a refreshing lecture on Git, Github, and Netlify.

### Day 14: August 19, 2023
![Week 2 Completed](https://github.com/rico042002/Rico-100-days-of-code/blob/master/img/week2.gif?raw=true)

**Today's Progress**: Finished SASS section of the course, starting the final Portfolio Project.

**Thoughts:** This is the final project of the course, I will be done in 2 days minimum. I'm going to work on the HTML&CSS youtube playlist Brad Traversy made for a developer roadmap so I can brush up on all the topics I've learned, and then move on to the Javascript list which includes the course I want to buy. That way I can start the 50days50projects course closer to day 50.

**Link to work:** [HTML & CSS Playlist (50+ Projects)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLillGF-RfqbZTASqIqdvm1R5mLrQq79CU)

### Day 15: August 20, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Set up everything for the portfolio project, and made the main header and navbar.

**Thoughts:** Sass is not easy, the nesting is confusing sometimes but I'm getting the hang of it. It's not that I don't like it, just not used to the syntax.

### Day 16: August 21, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: Continued Portfolio Project, almost done with the landing page.

**Thoughts:** Had fun today, and had a bunch of issues with typos, so I guess you can say it was an off day. Forgot a quotation mark in a data set for a javascript function so the typewriter effect didn't originally work, then I had padding issues that I think had more to do with the fact that Brad records his course videos from big screen TVs, so I had to use 10% padding, where his suggestion is 20%. Either way it was fun to debug some code and have some issues to make everything the way I wanted it to look.

### Day 17: August 22, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Finished home landing page, started about.html

**Thoughts:** Using Sass and animations has increased the time on the videos but they are still entertaining and educating me so much on CSS! I want to learn so much more about it so I can make cool layouts and pages in the future.

### Day 18: August 23, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: Finished about page!

**Thoughts:** Learned some cool CSS tricks, like how to create a progress bar with pure CSS. I also understand how and when Divs are needed, I'm making awesome pace on the course and I'm five videos away from being done! I'm probably going to continue the HTML/CSS part of the roadmap before jumping into JavaScript, but I will definitely be getting his JS Course soon.

### Day 0: August 0, 2023 EXAMPLE
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, and worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
