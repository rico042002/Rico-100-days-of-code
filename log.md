# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 6, 2023
![It Has Begun](https://github.com/rico042002/Rico-100-days-of-code/blob/master/img/mk.gif?raw=true)

**Today's Progress**: Learned about flexbox and started new project site. Continuing the course "Modern HTML & CSS From The Beginning (Including Sass)" by Brad Traversy

**Thoughts:** I struggle with coding daily. At times, frustration threatens to consume me as I fight to comprehend programming concepts that others seem to grasp effortlessly. Every line of code feels like an intricate puzzle, and debugging can become an all-consuming battle. My self-doubt looms, and I've questioned whether I have what it takes to be a programmer for years. This round is more important than the previous ones, my support system is few in numbers but consists of some of the best programmers any beginner could ask for!

### Day 2: August 7, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: Contiued project site with the course, learned more about flexbox and used CSS Variables.

**Thoughts:** It feels good to be coding daily, I plan on holding my streak without breaking stride. I have plenty of work to do and a lot of material to cover. I'm going to finish two more Udemy courses to prepare myself for daily challenges on iCodeThis.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
