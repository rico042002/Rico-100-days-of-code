## Log

### R2D1: December 14, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Started Modules & Tooling section of Javascript Course

**Thoughts:** I was like 4 lessons in on the modules section and decided to start the entire section over to get a refresher. Read my notes on NodeJS and how NPM worksâ€”learned about npm flags and how to use a .gitignore on node_modules. It feels good to be back, still waiting on the new cohort of #100Devs to start in January. I want to complete this course and 50 days/50 projects before I start the boot camp. I also want to start the js.info book and complete FCC's Javascript DSA section. I don't want to add too much to my schedule and get overwhelmed again. So it's one course or one book at a time!

**Today's Progress**: Learned about Module Bundlers and started working with WebPack to refactor the previous Track Calorie App. 

**Thoughts:** Today's lesson was loads of fun, finally learned what Babel does, and why module bundlers are needed. I've heard quite a few programmers mention dev-environment but this is my first time creating one. Tomorrow's lesson should be promising, I have also been reading JS.info in my spare time, not a requirement but as some free time reading that I'm not forcing myself to do but just to supplement my learning.

### R2D3: December 17, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: Set up a dev-environment and learned about Webpack Plugins. 

**Thoughts:** Today's lesson seemed long, ran into a few typo issues but still finished. Spent yesterday working and it got late so I forgot to code. I'm going to try to start coding more during the day so I don't forget or try to squeeze it in at the end of the day.

### R2D4: December 18, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: Refactoring Calorie Tracking App, added CSS-Extract plugin to Webpack 

**Thoughts:** Started refactoring code for the track calorie app, separated the long JS file into separate smaller ones. Almost done with the section of the course.

### R2D5: December 19, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Completed refactoring Tracalorie App with Webpack, deployed to Netlify. Finished the section, and learned about Symbols & Iterators

**Thoughts:** Had to do some late-night coding because I left my laptop at home today, still managed to get my hour in at the last minute. It went by slow as hell but I managed to truck through it ðŸ˜†

### R2D0: December 0, 2023 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
