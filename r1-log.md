## Log

### R2D1: December 14, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Started Modules & Tooling section of Javascript Course

**Thoughts:** I was like 4 lessons in on the modules section and decided to start the entire section over to get a refresher. Read my notes on NodeJS and how NPM worksâ€”learned about npm flags and how to use a .gitignore on node_modules. It feels good to be back, still waiting on the new cohort of #100Devs to start in January. I want to complete this course and 50 days/50 projects before I start the boot camp. I also want to start the js.info book and complete FCC's Javascript DSA section. I don't want to add too much to my schedule and get overwhelmed again. So it's one course or one book at a time!

### R2D2: December 15, 2023


**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
